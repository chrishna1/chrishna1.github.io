Hey there, hope you're having fun.

My name is Krishna. I accidently fell into the well of programming many years ago. Now, it's hard even to think of coming out of it. When I started, didn't think it'll be the source of my bread and butter. But yeah, it happened and I'm glad and grateful to be in this field.

When not in front of screen, I love spending time outdoor. Mostly on my cycle roaming randomly around any part of the world. 

Apart from that I like to spend time with musical instruments - Tabla, Harmonium. 

Other topics of interest - sustainability, fitness, startup, history(not just political but food, textile, language, etc), evolution, psychology, kids, electronics, urban issues, city masterplans, etc.

Would love to have a talk on my topics of interest or outside it. Just ping me on any of social media profile or hi[at]bkjha[dot]com.
