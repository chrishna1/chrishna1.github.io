In our lifetime we have to make hundreds of decisions, few important ones, which might have lasting impact on how we live rest of our life.

which college
which course
which institutes
which job
which phone/laptop


few hundreds years back, choices were few, there weren't a central agency to rank all the options. so people chose whatever options they had at their disposal. 

as we developed, number of choices went up and so to simplify the choice of choosing, ranking agencies came in.

who does it help?
just a few people on the top.

who does it harm?
rest of us.

what to do then?

research, research, and research.. for as long as possible.. as early as possible.. from as many angles as possible.. if it's physical, inspect it by going close to it.. 

real world is too complicated and it has too many variables to reduce it to just one number.. imagine reducing a person's identity to just one single number and that is his/her height. how stupid that is. there might be hundreds of amazing properties but you miss all those things.
