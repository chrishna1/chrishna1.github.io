hi, aadab, namaskar, sat sri akal, hola


it's been more than 2 and half year since i last posted something here. i'll use this post as an opportunity to go back in time. 

it's been so long that i even forgot how to use Hugo(the framework used for this blog). in between, the domain had expired. thankfully no one claimed it for more than an year - perks of choosing a not so fancy domain name. i bought back the domain, made the blog live again. i was really missing this outlet.  


so many things have happened during this time. i'll briefly cover that. some of the events need a full-blown article on them for justice, hopefully it'll come soon.

### on the professional front

- left Vitrana and took a new job in a startup
- learnt loads of technologies. i miss not sharing my learnings here. it was really fun. 
- left (struggling) startup to take a break. been more than six months now. tried working on a commercial side project.

### on the personal front

- picked up multiple hobbies
  - running
  - cycling
  - swimming
  - tabla
  - harmonium

- started reading newspaper. started with The Indian Express, then added Jansatta a few months later, then added businessline just recently. now it's getting beyond my capacity, will reduce. reading physical newspaper is fun though - especially on the weekends with pen in hand.

- visited a couple of cities
  - shimla
  - chandigarh
  - bengaluru
  - mumbai
  - jaipur


- spent quality time with my young friends(lavi - 6yo, nonu - 10+yo, and their friends duggu, ishi, mahi, harsh, aarush, shivam). they are wonderful. i learnt a lot from them. it was hard to match their enthusiasm, energy, innocence. but they've brought these things back in me, slowly, bit by bit.


- my taste in music has changed. now it's mostly indian classical instrumental music - sitar, sarod, shehnai, bansuri, santoor, veena, etc. i find them peaceful and soothing.



## what next

still in the soul-searching phase, slowly coming to realise(but not able to accept) that my true love lies in coding, tinkering with stuff, research rather than dealing with people, finance. but that conflicts with my long term ambition of building something great.

irrespective of what happens on the professional front, i'd like to write here more frequently.


bye, khuda hafiz, alvida

PS: i've intentionally used lowercase everywhere in this post. aargh, effect of using too much cred app.
