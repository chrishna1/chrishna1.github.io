Spec vs Gen

Why not both.

let's say you're a software developer. you specialize in software engineering. 
you can master specialization by building solutions for wildly different domains - from medical to law, from horticulture to aviation, from govt industry to petroleum industry etc..

the goal is to specialize in your field but not by completing a superficial project instead by challenging yourself to acquire domain knowledge and utilising your specialisation to solve it..

I understand not every field is as broadly applicable as software engineering, but to some extent, you can push every domain.
