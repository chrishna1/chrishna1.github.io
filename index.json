[{"content":"When was the last time you visited a temple? How often do you visit temples?\nThe answer to these questions will change significantly based on the generation you belong to. And that\u0026rsquo;s fine. I don\u0026rsquo;t have the exact data to back up my point, but based on my observations, newer generations are not visiting religious places as enthusiastically and regularly as the previous generations. Which becomes obvious, when we factor in the changes that have happened in our upbringing, in terms of education, access to content, etc. I don\u0026rsquo;t get bothered by the rise and fall of these numbers, the only thing in which I\u0026rsquo;m interested is, increasing the usefulness of the investment in religious infra that we have made in the past 2-3 millennia.\nWe, as a society, have showered a lot of capital on the religious infra. In fact, investment made on these religious infra will be orders of magnitude higher than any other projects undertaken by the community as a whole.\nThis prompted me to think of ways, we as a society, can reap the benefits of these investments.\nTill now, these places have remained \u0026ldquo;places of worship\u0026rdquo;, with a few exceptions of fair, rituals, etc. But as the worshipping God is losing charm, so does the significance of these places. We have to identify the needs of the current and future generations and based on that we can take steps.\nIf you ask me personally, what would I like to have there, it would be\ninteractive discussion on sacred books. Note that, interactivity here is important. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to just listen to the stories. People would take home some lessons, read it carefully and then indulge in discussions.\nYoga\nSpiritual talks\nContemporary Literature. Works of local, young people.\nIndian Classical Music. Both recital and lessons. I feel very close to this and this is my way to connect with the Supreme God.\nClassical Dance. Be the Nataraj!\nA place to discuss how the overall mental and physical well-being of the society can be improved, and then taking some actions towards that.\nPeriodic Art and Craft performance. Medium to connect with God differs with every individual. Everyone should be able to showcase their experience.\nand many more.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not necessary to have it all. Just one of the above is also fine. It\u0026rsquo;s just that it should feel authentic and fluid and not like a forced ritual, again!\nTo avoid transforming these places into typical capitalist institution, we should start funding these new initiatives separately, similar to how the society funds the livelihood of priests and caretaker of people working at these places. It\u0026rsquo;s easier said than done. It\u0026rsquo;ll require lots of trial and error, but I\u0026rsquo;m sure with honest goodwill, this can definitely be achieved.\nGenerally, the location of religious place is far from the densely populated areas. And sometimes, there is a pond, large trees to make the place even more soothing and peaceful. Which makes it a perfect place for the above activities.\nJust imagine taking a morning Kathak class beneath a large banyan tree, beside a large pond, and the cold breeze of the morning, witnessing the sunrise!\nसाक्षात प्रभु का दर्शन\nI daydream a lot!\n","permalink":"https://www.bkjha.com/posts/future-of-reglious-places/","summary":"When was the last time you visited a temple?

But no one told us what exactly is Ubuntu. Prior to that, I had used Windows extensively for over a decade. Like everyone else I was clueless about this, and like everyone I also got it formatted with Windows. But something weird happened, and my system got infected with virus. As far as I can remember, system started behaving weirdly, language got changed(to Mandarin/Korean I guess) and so on. It was painful to operate. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t disinfect my system with my limited knowledge and internet bandwith back then(no broadband connection, and just 2GB data per month on 3G on my smartphone). And few weeks later, we have to return our laptop as semester got over. I had no personal laptop back then. One thing that I clearly remember is that, I loved the simple and fast, but unfamiliar Ubuntu over bloated and slow, familiar Windows. So, I had decided that whenever I\u0026rsquo;ll buy a new laptop I\u0026rsquo;ll install Ubuntu on it. Fast forward few months, I bought a laptop, unsurprisingly Windows installed on it. Since the laptop was a very old model with poor specs, it couldn\u0026rsquo;t handle the Windows bloatedness.\nI decided to install Ubuntu on it but I had literally no idea how to do it. Windows can be installed at any cybercafe near you but no one was aware of Ubuntu. Neither I had any friend who were using it. So I was stuck. I took help of youtube videos, bought a pendrive, flashed it with Ubuntu. But got stuck at GRUB error. And was stuck there for many days!! Thankfully there was a person in a slack group(Devs and Hackers) that helped me out. I\u0026rsquo;m so grateful to him. He helped me during his office hours(don\u0026rsquo;t know how). His lunch got delayed to 5PM, I guess. He has hell-bent to get this problem solved. The slack thread had over 100 messages. Finally, I could see the splash screen. Yeahhh!!! Couldn\u0026rsquo;t have been more happy that day. This incident also changed me as a person to help others, even strangers, selflessly \u0026ndash; just because you love your work. But this will be a separate article.\nThis was a biggest turning point in my life. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know back then that I would love this so much that this(programming) would be my bread and butter one day. The sheer joy of knowing that an application is open-source and looking at the source code of the application is beyond any explanation. I can sacrifice a lot on great user-interface, features, latency, stability, and so on just because something is open-source. This level of obsession is not a good thing, I know, but yeah, this is what it is.\nList of FOSS This is a list of FOSS, that I personally use. Note that, I prefer using FOSS but there are some situations where you can avoid the big players. So, when I say I use Organic Maps, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean I don\u0026rsquo;t ever use Google Maps.\nDesktop Ubuntu(primary Operating System) LibreOffice software suite(alternative of Microsoft Word, Excel, etc) Audacity(Voice Recording) Calibre(eBooks) VLC(Media Player) Firefox/Brave SimpleScreenRecorder CopyQ(Clipboard manager) Remmina(Remote Desktop Client) FlameShot(Screenshot) Wireshark(Packet Inspection/Analyser) Android F-Droid(FOSS repository) Organic Maps Fossify Gallery Harmonic(For Hackernews) Infinity(For Reddit) Librera Conversations(XMPP/Jabber client for Android) I\u0026rsquo;m grateful to all the wonderful people behind these projects. In terms of contribution, I\u0026rsquo;ve done nothing beyond raising few issues and starring a project, but I\u0026rsquo;ll fix that soon. Being part of a community that\u0026rsquo;s always ready to help and go extra mile is just awesome. Such experiences have changed me as a person and helped me shape my view outside the techincal field as well.\nHappy FOSSing\n","permalink":"https://www.bkjha.com/posts/my-foss-journey/","summary":"Note - I keep updating this article as I start using a new FOSS application/software.\nJourney began in late 2016, when free laptop was being distributed by my alma mater with Ubuntu Operating System on it.
