Your general approach might be to upload it to your organization\u0026rsquo;s document/file storage platform(e.g OneDrive) and share it. If you\u0026rsquo;ve to do this multiple times, it\u0026rsquo;s boring to perform the same steps over and over again!\nWhat about automating this process? As soon as your report is generated you can run a command that will copy your file present in local to OneDrive server. That would be awesome, right? To achieve that you can use a powerful tool - rclone.\nToday, I\u0026rsquo;ll describe how to configure rclone with OneDrive(Business plan). rclone doesn\u0026rsquo;t need an introduction but in case you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar with it \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s the most popular open-source cli tool to interact with your cloud storage providers. It supports more than 40 cloud storage providers out of the box.\nIf you have business API access provided by your admin then it\u0026rsquo;s pretty straightforward to configure. But if you don\u0026rsquo;t have the API access then you\u0026rsquo;ll get the following error while authentication.\nIt is because official API is protected and can only be enabled by an administrator. But don\u0026rsquo;t worry. We have an alternative.\nWe can use webdav protocol supported by SharePoint and also by rclone luckily.\nYour configuration process should look like\n~ rclone config No remotes found - make a new one n) New remote s) Set configuration password q) Quit config n/s/q\u0026gt; n name\u0026gt; work_onedrive Type of storage to configure.
