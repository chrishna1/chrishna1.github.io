      <description>Hi there &amp;#x1f44b;
If you&amp;rsquo;re trying to install/update/remove/fix a debian package and getting the error mentioned in title, and none of the following commands are working,
sudo apt-get remove sudo apt-get install sudo apt-get purge sudo apt-get autoremove sudo apt-get autoclean sudo apt-get install -f you&amp;rsquo;re at the right place.
You&amp;rsquo;ll face this error if you&amp;rsquo;ve terminated the installation process of a software package. You may&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten, when and why did you terminate the installation, but that&amp;rsquo;s not an issue, you&amp;rsquo;ll still be able to fix this issue.</description>

      <description>Hi there &amp;#x1f44b;
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have to share a report that you&amp;rsquo;re generating programmatically with a consultant in your company every week. Your general approach might be to upload it to your organization&amp;rsquo;s document/file storage platform(e.g OneDrive) and share it. If you&amp;rsquo;ve to do this multiple times, it&amp;rsquo;s boring to perform the same steps over and over again!
What about automating this process? As soon as your report is generated you can run a command that will copy your file present in local to OneDrive server.</description>

      <description>Hi there &amp;#x1f44b;
Finally, I&amp;rsquo;m done with the setup of my blog. The purpose of this blog will be to share the
&amp;#x1f4ac; Concepts that I keep learning in a simple language &amp;#x1f4da; Books that I read and many other things, that I&amp;rsquo;m also not sure about. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope this blogging spirit continues forever! &amp;#x1f60e;
Have fun, Keep hacking!</description>
