      <description>Hi there &amp;#x1f44b;
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have to share a report that you&amp;rsquo;re generating programmatically with a consultant in your company every week. Your general approach might be to upload it to your organization&amp;rsquo;s document/file storage platform(e.g OneDrive) and share it. If you&amp;rsquo;ve to do this multiple times, it&amp;rsquo;s boring to perform the same steps over and over again!
What about automating this process? As soon as your report is generated you can run a command that will copy your file present in local to OneDrive server.</description>
