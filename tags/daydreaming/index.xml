      <description>When was the last time you visited a temple? How often do you visit temples?
The answer to these questions will change significantly based on the generation you belong to. And that&amp;rsquo;s fine. I don&amp;rsquo;t have the exact data to back up my point, but based on my observations, newer generations are not visiting religious places as enthusiastically and regularly as the previous generations. Which becomes obvious, when we factor in the changes that have happened in our upbringing, in terms of education, access to content, etc.</description>
